We pull most of these with Serper, specifically their google reviews. \\n\\nYou can use this as a boring first line or you can mine the google reviews for more information. \\n\\nThis is one of the few times that we are switching from usually using 4o mini and using gemini flash 2.0 instead. A customer showed us that it passes \"the needle in the haystick\" test better and now we use it to parse reviews for keywords or insights we are looking for. \\n\\n2) Their customer stories on the site that give more insights than just reviews. This we get with Claygent. I can tell you all love this because I've been getting far more emails mentioning the case studies on my website than I ever have before. \\n\\n3) Pricing if it's listed. This can give some ideas if they have multiple packages or if they are a low cost provider vs a premium provider. \\n\\n4) Support phone numbers if listed. \\n\\n5) We use an mx lookup tool to find how old the website is and when it was registered as well if we have someone that wants to find companies that just started or are much older. \\n\\n6) Competitors in the area. We use Apify and Serper to get this by just doing a google maps search and excluding the prospective company from our output. \\n\\nAnything you else you manually search for about local businesses and don't know how to get the data?\"\n\n\"Example output\": \n\"6 ways to target local businesses.\n\nThese are common data points you can use to pull information that can often tie into multiple offers.\n\nIt's worth noting that all the best AI strategies for outbound campaigns come from automating the same workflows you would use manually when reaching out to a company.\n\n1. Their online reviews. We use Google reviews, and if you're sourcing leads from Outscraper, you already have their Google reviews link. We ask Claygent to scan these and identify relevant insights based on keywords you're targeting.\n\n2. Case studies and success stories. Claygent can visit their website and extract relevant case studies. This approach has been delivering excellent results recently.\n\n3. Pricing information if published. This gives you insights into their offer structure, whether they operate in high or low ticket ranges, and if they provide multiple service packages.\n\n4. Published phone numbers (whether for support or general inquiries).\n\n5. Social media presence. Many local business owners don't maintain updated websites, so it's valuable to also examine their Facebook page using Apify. This often reveals important details like direct contact emails and phone numbers.\n\n6. Local competition landscape. Use Apify to analyze Google Maps search results while excluding the prospective company from your output.\n\nAnything else I missed?\"","options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent","typeVersion":1.9,"position":[1240,0],"id":"d302029b-f09c-4979-bef4-222234877ed8","name":"AI Agent"},{"parameters":{"model":{"__rl":true,"mode":"list","value":"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219","cachedResultName":"Claude 3.7 Sonnet"},"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatAnthropic","typeVersion":1.3,"position":[1240,180],"id":"a6660a04-7685-48c0-9600-bf3734981b10","name":"Anthropic Chat Model","credentials":{"anthropicApi":{"id":"R577E9P3r5txdxYS","name":"Anthropic account"}}},{"parameters":{"assignments":{"assignments":[{"id":"72c91d41-28dd-43c6-8be6-4812a02d12cd","name":"posted_at.relative","value":"={{ $json.posted_at.relative }}","type":"string"},{"id":"b9f9acfd-3edb-4980-9fd6-20d904472fe5","name":"text","value":"={{ $json.text }}","type":"string"},{"id":"365573f3-7d85-46d4-a2e7-bea8acbe47f6","name":"url","value":"={{ $json.url }}","type":"string"},{"id":"9547dd96-31e0-4c46-9a9a-7077ddd93525","name":"post_type","value":"={{ $json.post_type }}","type":"string"}]},"options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.set","typeVersion":3.4,"position":[440,0],"id":"72bd3088-ba44-4d24-a6ed-a3a94b3a5cd9","name":"Set variables"},{"parameters":{"operation":"append","documentId":{"__rl":true,"value":"1fkKW33HksdVKJyqzAHCoGi2sUGdMeo4JEqjrYW_3kZQ","mode":"list","cachedResultName":"Post database - JKD","cachedResultUrl":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fkKW33HksdVKJyqzAHCoGi2sUGdMeo4JEqjrYW_3kZQ/edit?usp=drivesdk"},"sheetName":{"__rl":true,"value":"gid=0","mode":"list","cachedResultName":"outboundphd","cachedResultUrl":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fkKW33HksdVKJyqzAHCoGi2sUGdMeo4JEqjrYW_3kZQ/edit#gid=0"},"columns":{"mappingMode":"defineBelow","value":{"draft":"={{ $json.output }}","content":"={{ $('Set variables').item.json.text }}","url":"={{ $('Set variables').item.json.url }}","type":"={{ $('Set variables').item.json.post_type }}","posted at":"={{ $('Set variables').item.json.posted_at.relative }}"},"matchingColumns":[],"schema":[{"id":"url","displayName":"url","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true},{"id":"posted at","displayName":"posted at","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true,"removed":false},{"id":"content","displayName":"content","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true},{"id":"type","displayName":"type","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true},{"id":"image ","displayName":"image ","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true,"removed":true},{"id":"draft","displayName":"draft","required":false,"defaultMatch":false,"display":true,"type":"string","canBeUsedToMatch":true}],"attemptToConvertTypes":false,"convertFieldsToString":false},"options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets","typeVersion":4.5,"position":[1600,0],"id":"a9629b8f-a2a3-4927-9f6a-8c07a94514b1","name":"Google Sheets","credentials":{"googleSheetsOAuth2Api":{"id":"x0hNyWm5H4QES6uR","name":"ONECLICK - Google Sheets"}}},{"parameters":{"formTitle":"LinkedIn Parasite","formDescription":"Who do I scrape?","formFields":{"values":[{"fieldLabel":"LinkedIn URL","placeholder":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/theclayguy/","requiredField":true}]},"options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger","typeVersion":2.2,"position":[20,0],"id":"863d47e9-b11b-49d4-8394-1947b0f1e7f2","name":"On form submission","webhookId":"1c1bf0a0-e2d9-471f-aa13-5d9d16006508"},{"parameters":{"sendTo":"stas@oneclick.si","subject":"New scrape finished.","emailType":"text","message":"=Hi, just finished your new scrape.
